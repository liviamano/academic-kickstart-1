# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We demonstrate the first prototype of the ADD-up visual analytics system. The Augmented Deliberative Democracy (ADD-up) project aims to enhance public deliberations by providing argument analytics in real time. The system will ultimately take a stenographic feed of a public deliberation meeting, automatically extract the arguments therein and project visual analytics intended to improve the deliberative quality of the event."
